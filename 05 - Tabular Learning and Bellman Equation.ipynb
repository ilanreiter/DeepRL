    "# Tabular Learning and the Bellman Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter, we got acquainted with our first Reinforcement Learning (**RL**) method, **cross-entropy**, and saw its strengths and weaknesses. In this new part of the book, we'll look at another group of methods, called **Q-learning**, which have much more flexibility and power.\n",
    "This chapter will establish the required background shared by those methods. We'll also revisit the FrozenLake environment and show how new concepts will fit with this environment and help us to address the issues of the environment's uncertainty.\n",

    "### Belman Equation of Value - Determinsitc Case\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/Ch5-Fig3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Value of state $S_0$ is equal to the maximum of the sum of the possible rewards and the value of the next step over all possible actions. So, to choose the best possible action, the agent needs to calculate the resulting values for every action and choose the maximum possible outcome. This is a recursive claulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$V_0 = \\max\\in_{1...N}(r_a + \\gamma V_a)$ **Belman Equation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "* $\\gamma$ : discount value\n",
    "* $r_a$: reward of action $a$\n",
    "* $V_a$: value of next state given action $a$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Belman Equation of Value - Stochastic Case\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/Ch5-Fig4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "$V_0 = \\max_{a \\in A}\\mathbb{E}_{s~S}(r_{s,a} + \\gamma V_s) = \\max_{a \\in A} \\sum_{s \\in S}p_{a,0 \\rightarrow s}(r_{s,a} + \\gamma V_s)$   \n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "* $p_{a,0 \\rightarrow s}$: probability of action $a$, issued in state $i$, to end up in state $j$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Value of action\n",
    "\n",
    "Value of action is equals the total reward we can get by executing action $a$ in state $s$ and can be defined via $V_s$. This quantity gave a name to the whole family of methods called **\"Q-learning\"**, because it is slightly more convenient in practice. In these methods, our primary objective is to get values of $Q$ for every pair of state and action. \n",
    "The Q value is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Q_{s,a} = \\mathbb{E}_{s'~S}(r_{s,a} + \\gamma V_{s'}) = \\sum_{s \\in S}p_{a,s \\rightarrow s'}(r_{s,a} + \\gamma V_{s'})$   \n",
    "\n",
    "$Q$ for this state $s$ and action a equals the expected immediate reward and the discounted long-term reward of the destination state $s'$. \n",
    "We also can define $V_s$ via $Q_{s,a}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$V_s = \\max_{a \\in A}Q_{s,a}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This just means that the value of some state equals to the value of the maximum action we can execute from this state. It may look very close to the value of state, but there is still a difference, which is important to understand. Finally, we can express $Q(s, a)$ via itself, which will be used in the next chapter's topic of **Q-learning**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Q(s, a) = r_{s,a} + \\gamma \\max_{a' \\in A}Q(s',a')$\n",

    "### Value Integration Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The  **\"value iteration algorithm\"** allows us to numerically calculate the values of states and values of actions of MDPs with known transition probabilities and rewards. \n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure (for **values of states**) includes the following steps:\n",
    "1. Initialize values of all states Vi to some initial value (usually zero) \n",
    "2. For every state s in the MDP, perform the Bellman update:\n",
    "$$Vs \\leftarrow \\max_{a \\in A} \\sum_{s'}p_{a,s \\rightarrow s'}(r_{s,a} + \\gamma V_s')$$\n",
    "3. Repeat step 2 for some large number of steps or until changes become too small\n",
    "\n",
    "For f action values (**Q-Value**), only minor modifications to the preceding procedure are required:\n",
    "1. Initialize all Qs,a to zero \n",
    "2. For every state s and every action a in this state, perform update: \n",
    "$$Q_{s,a} \\leftarrow \\sum_{s'}p_{a,s \\rightarrow s'}(r_{s,a} + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q_{s',a'})$$\n",
    "3. Repeat step 2\n",
    "\n",
    "### Value iteration in practice\n",
    "\n",
    "The central data structures in this example are as follows: \n",
    "* **Reward table**: A dictionary with the composite key \"source state\" + \"action\" + \"target state\". The value is obtained from the immediate reward.\n",
    "* **Transitions table**: A dictionary keeping counters of the experienced transitions. The key is the composite \"state\" + \"action\" and the value is another dictionary that maps the target state into a count of times that we've seen it. For example, if in state 0 we execute action 1 ten times, after three times it leads us to state 4 and after seven times to state 5. Entry with the key (0, 1) in this table will be a dict {4: 3, 5: 7}. We use this table to estimate the probabilities of our transitions.\n",
    "* **Value table**: A dictionary that maps a state into the calculated value of this state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall logic of our code is simple: in the loop, we play 100 random steps from the environment, populating the reward and transition tables. After those 100 steps, we perform a value iteration loop over all states, updating our value table. Then we play several full episodes to check our improvements using the updated value table. If the average reward for those test episodes is above the 0.8 boundary, then we stop training. During test episodes, we also update our reward and transition tables to use all data from the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "First the Agent class code, which will keep our tables and contain functions we'll be using in the training loop:\n"
