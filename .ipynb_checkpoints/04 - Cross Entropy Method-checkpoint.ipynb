    "# Chapter 4 - The Cross Entropy Method\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Taxonomy of RL methods \n",
    "\n",
    "The cross-entropy method falls into the model-free and policy-based category of methods. These notions are new, so let's spend some time exploring them. All methods in RL can be classified into various aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Model-free or model-based \n",
    "* Value-based or policy-based \n",
    "* On-policy or off-policy\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other ways that you can taxonomize RL methods, but for now we're interested in the preceding three.\n",
    "Let's define them, as your problem specifics can influence your decision on a particular method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term **model-free** means that the method **doesn't build a model** of the environment or reward; it just directly connects observations to actions (or values that are related to actions). In other words, the agent takes current observations and does some computations on them, and the result is the action that it should take. In contrast, **model-based** methods try to **predict what the next observation and/ or reward will be**. Based on this prediction, the agent is trying to choose the best possible action to take, very often making such predictions multiple times to **look more and more steps into the future**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both classes of methods have strong and weak sides, but usually pure **model-based methods are used in deterministic environments**, such as board games with strict rules. On the other hand, model-free methods are usually easier to train as it's hard to build good models of complex environments with rich observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of the methods described in this book are from the **model-free** category, as those methods have been the most active area of research for the past few years. Only recently have researchers started to mix the benefits from both worlds (for example, refer to DeepMind's papers on imagination in agents. This approach will be described in Chapter 17, Beyond Model-Free â€“ Imagination).\n",
    "\n",
    "By looking from an other angle, **policy-based methods** are directly approximating the policy of the agent, that is, what **actions the agent should carry out at every step**. Policy is usually represented by **probability distribution over the available actions**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the method could be **value-based**. In this case, instead of the probability of actions, the agent calculates the **value of every possible action** and chooses the action with the best value. Both of those families of methods are equally popular and we'll discuss value-based methods in the next part of the book. Policy methods will be the topic of part three.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third important classification of methods is on-policy versus off-policy. We'll discuss this distinction more in parts two and three of the book, but for now, it will be enough to explain **off-policy** as the ability of the method to **learn on old historical data** (obtained by a previous version of the agent or recorded by human demonstration or just seen by the same agent several episodes ago).\n",
    "So, our **cross-entropy method is model-free, policy-based, and on-policy**, which means the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It **doesn't build any model** of the environment; it just says to the agent what to do at every step\n",
    "* It **approximates the policy of the agent**\n",
    "* It requires **fresh data** obtained from the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical cross-entropy \n",
    "\n",
    "The cross-entropy method description is split into two unequal parts: practical and theoretical.\n",
    "The practical part is intuitive in its nature, while the theoretical explanation of why cross-entropy works, and what's happening is more sophisticated.\n",
    "You may remember that the central, trickiest thing in RL is the agent, which is trying to accumulate as much total reward as possible by communicating with the environment. In practice, we follow a common ML approach and replace all of the complications of the agent with some kind of nonlinear trainable function, which maps the agent's input (observations from the environment) to some output. The details of the output that this function produces may depend on a particular method or a family of methods, as described in the previous section (such as value-based versus policy-based methods). As our cross-entropy method is policy-based, our **nonlinear function (neural network) produces policy**, which basically says for every observation which action the agent should take.\n",
    "![](img/fig4-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, **policy** is usually represented as **probability distribution over actions**, which makes it very similar to a classification problem, with the amount of classes being equal to amount of actions we can carry out. This abstraction makes our agent very simple: it needs to pass an observation from the environment to the network, get probability distribution over actions, and **perform random sampling using probability distribution to get an action to carry out**. This random sampling adds randomness to our agent, which is a good thing, as at the beginning of the training when our weights are random, the agent behaves randomly. After the agent gets an action to issue, it fires the action to the environment and obtains the next observation and reward for the last action. Then the loop continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the agent's lifetime, its experience is present as **episodes**. Every episode is a **sequence of observations** that the agent has got from the environment, actions it has issued, and rewards for these actions. Imagine that our agent has played several such episodes. For every episode, we can calculate the total reward that the agent has claimed. It can be **discounted or not discounted**, but for simplicity, let's assume a discount factor of gamma = 1, which means just a sum of all local rewards for every episode. This total reward shows how good this episode was for the agent. Let's illustrate this with a diagram, which contains four episodes (note that different episodes have different values for Oi\n",
    ", ai , and ri ):\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/fig4-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Every cell represents the agent's step in the episode. Due to randomness in the environment and the way that the agent selects actions to take, some episodes will be better than others. **The core of the cross-entropy method is to throw away bad episodes and train on better ones**. So, the steps of the method are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Play **N number of episodes** using our current model and environment. \n",
    "2. Calculate the total **reward for every episode** and decide on a reward boundary. Usually, we use some percentile of all rewards, such as 50th or 70th.\n",
    "3. Throw away all episodes with a reward below the boundary.\n",
    "4. **Train on the remaining \"elite\" episodes** using observations as the input and issued actions as the desired output.\n",
    "5. Repeat from step 1 until we become satisfied with the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, that's all about the cross-entropy method description. With the preceding procedure, **our neural network learns how to repeat actions, which leads to a larger reward**, constantly moving the boundary higher and higher. Despite the simplicity of this method, it works well in simple environments, it's easy to implement, and it's quite robust to hyperparameters changing, which makes it an ideal baseline method to try. Let's now apply it to our CartPole environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cross-entropy on CartPole\n",
    "The whole code for this example is in ``Chapter04/01_cartpole.py``, but the following are the most important parts. Our model's core is a one-hidden-layer neural network, with ReLU and 128 hidden neurons (which is absolutely arbitrary). Other hyperparameters are also set almost randomly and aren't tuned, as the method is robust and converges very quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The  network\n",
    "* Input - a single observation from the environment as an input vector\n",
    "* Output- a number for every action we can perform - \n",
    "\n",
    "The output from the network is a probability distribution over actions, so a straightforward way to proceed would be to include softmax nonlinearity after the last layer. However, in the preceding network we don't apply softmax to increase the numerical stability of the training process. Rather than calculating softmax (which uses exponentiation) and then calculating cross-entropy loss (which uses logarithm of probabilities), we'll use the PyTorch class, ``nn.CrossEntropyLoss``, which **combines both softmax and cross-entropy** in a single, more numerically stable expression. CrossEntropyLoss requires raw, unnormalized values from the network (also called logits), and the downside of this is that we need to remember to apply softmax every time we need to get probabilities from our network's output."

Its world is from the so-called \"grid world\" category, when your agent lives in a grid of size 4 Ã— 4 and can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. The agent always starts at a top-left position, and its goal is to reach the bottom-right cell of the grid. There are holes in the fixed cells of the grid and if you get into those holes, the episode ends and your reward is zero. If the agent reaches the destination cell, then it obtains the reward 1.0 and the episode ends.\n",
    "To make life more complicated, the world is slippery (it's a frozen lake after all), so the agent's actions do not always turn out as expected: there is a 33% chance that it will slip to the right or to the left. You want the agent to move left, for example, but there is a 33% probability that it will indeed move left, a 33% chance that it will end up in the cell above, and a 33% chance that it will end up in the cell below. As we'll see at the end of the section, this makes progress difficult.\n",

    "### Gym Environment for FrozenLake\n",
    "\n",
    "Our observation space is discrete, which means that it's just a number from zero to 15 inclusive. Obviously, this number is our current position in the grid. The action space is also discrete, but can be from zero to three. Our network from the CartPole example expects a vector of numbers. To get this, we can apply the traditional \"one-hot encoding\" of discrete inputs, which means that input to our network will have 16 float numbers and zero everywhere, except the index that we'll encode. To minimize changes in our code, we can use the ObservationWrapper class from Gym and implement our DiscreteOneHotWrapper class.\n",
    "With that wrapper applied to the environment, both the observation space and action space are 100% compatible with our CartPole solution (source code Chapter04/02_ frozenlake_naive.py). So we can use the same code as above.\n",
    "However, by launching it, we can see that this doesn't improve the score over time.\n",
    "To understand what's going on, we need to look deeper at the reward structure of both environments. In CartPole, every step of the environment gives us the reward 1.0, until the moment that the pole falls. So, the longer our agent balanced the pole, the more reward it obtained. Due to randomness in our agent's behavior, different episodes were of different lengths, which gave us a pretty normal distribution of the episodes' rewards. After choosing a reward boundary, we rejected less successful episodes and learned how to repeat better ones (by training on successful episodes' data).\n",
    "This is shown in the following diagram:\n",
    "![](img/Fig7-1.png)\n",
    "In the FrozenLake environment, episodes and their reward look different. We get the reward of 1.0 only when we reach the goal, and this reward says nothing about how good each episode was. Was it quick and efficient or did we make four rounds on the lake before we randomly stepped into the final cell? We don't know, it's just 1.0 reward and that's it. The distribution of rewards for our episodes are also problematic. There are only two kinds of episodes possible, with zero reward (failed) and one reward (successful), and failed episodes will obviously dominate in the beginning of the training. So, our percentile selection of \"elite\" episodes is totally wrong and gives us bad examples to train on. This is the reason for our training failure.\n",
    "![](img/Fig8-1.png)\n",
    "This example shows us the limitations of the cross-entropy method: \n",
    "* For training, our **episodes** have to be **finite** and, preferably, **short**\n",
    "* The total reward for the **episodes** should have enough **variability** to **separate good episodes from bad ones**\n",
    "* There is no **intermediate indication** about whether the agent has succeeded or failed\n",
    "\n",
    "Later in the book, we'll become familiar with other methods, which address these limitations. For now, if you're curious about how FrozenLake can be solved using cross-entropy, here is a list of tweaks of the code that you need to make (the full example is in Chapter04/03_frozenlake_tweaked.py):\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Larger batches of played episodes:** In CartPole, it was enough to have 16 episodes on every iteration, but FrozenLake requires at least 100 just to get some successful episodes.\n",
    "* **Discount factor applied to reward:** To make the total reward for the episode depend on episode length, and add variety in episodes, we can use a discounted total reward with the discount factor 0.9 or 0.95. In this case, the reward for shorter episodes will be higher than the reward for longer ones.\n",
    "* **Keeping \"elite\" episodes for a longer time:** In the CartPole training, we sampled episodes from the environment, trained on the best ones, and threw them away. In FrozenLake, a successful episode is a much rarer animal, so we need to keep them for several iterations to train on them.\n",
    "* **Decrease learning rate:** This will give our network time to average more training samples.\n",
    "* **Much longer training time:** Due to the sparsity of successful episodes, and the random outcome of our actions, it's much harder for our network to get an idea of the best behavior to perform in any particular situation. To reach 50% successful episodes, about 5k training iterations are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "To incorporate all these into our code, we need to change the filter_batch function to calculate discounted reward and return \"elite\" episodes for us to keep:\n"
